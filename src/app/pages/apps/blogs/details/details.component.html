      But you cannot figure out what it is or what it can do. MTA web directory
      is the simplest way in which one can bid on a link, or a few links if they
      wish to do so. The link directory on MTA displays all of the links it
      currently has, and does so in alphabetical order, which makes it much
      easier for someone to find what they are looking for if it is something
      specific and they do not want to go through all the other sites and links
      as well. It allows you to start your bid at the bottom and slowly work
      your way to the top of the list.
